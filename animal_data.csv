Philippine Flying Lemur,"Flying lemur, Gliding lemur, Philippine colugo, Kagwang","The Philippine flying lemur or Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans ), known locally as kagwang, is one of two species of colugo or ""flying lemurs."" It is monotypic of its genus. Although called a flying lemur, it cannot fly and is not a lemur. Instead, it glides as it leaps among trees.
The kagwang belongs to the order Dermoptera that contains only two species, one of which is found in the Philippines, while the other, the Sunda flying lemur, is found in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. Recent research from genetic analysis suggests two other species, the Bornean flying lemur and the Javan flying lemur, may exist, as well, but they have yet to be officially classified.
Both species of Dermoptera are classified under the grandorder Euarchonta, which includes treeshrews and primates, as well as an extinct order of mammals, the Plesiadapiformes.

It lives in primary forest, secondary forest, rubber plantations and coconut groves in lowland and mountainous areas.","The Philippine flying lemur is under threat due to the loss of forest habitat, logging and the development of land for agriculture. The remaining members of this species now inhabit isolated fragments of forest. They are also hunted both for their soft fur and for their meat, considered a local delicacy.","This species is widespread and common. According to the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) resource, the total population size of the Philippine flying lemur is around 100, 000 individuals. Currently this species is classified as Least Concern (LC) and its numbers today remain stable.",Not much information is available about the Philippine flying lemur's role in their ecosystem services.,Stable,Least concern (LC)
